Lagune Mail v.1.1
Author: Shane McIntosh (http://lagune-software.com)

This is the currently live version of the Lagune Mail System. Also included
is the Apache website configuration, the GNU Screen script and the GNU chron job script that is run by chron to keep the site going.

I have of course removed any authentication passwords and hope you find this useful.

I will keep this Github project up to date with each finalized version of the website, so sorry but no dev versions as I keep them on a private SVN separate from the website server.
